**Hi there!** ðŸ‘‹ **My name is Shunyu Liu (åˆ˜é¡ºå®‡).** âœ¨

- ðŸŽ“ I received the Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer Science and Technology at <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Zhejiang University</a> in 2024, advised by Prof. <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Mingli Song</a> and Prof. <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0082004" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Chun Chen</a>, and received the B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from <a href="https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Sun Yat-sen University</a> in 2019. 
- ðŸ¥³ My research interests include **multi-agent learning**, **reinforcement learning** and **graph learning**. Applications of my work include autonomous **power system dispatch and control**, as well as applications in other decision-making domains. The long-term goal of my research is to develop efficient, generalized, and practical agents. In tandem with this, my research strives to facilitate intelligent interaction among multiple agents, empowering them to tackle complex decision-making challenges in both the virtual and real worlds.
